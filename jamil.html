		 <h1>Jamil</h1>
		 <p> I will stay strong to help every body around me. I will always work my hardest to be great
		 I am strong because I am loved by the earth family and friends.
		 The sun shines on my skin and empowers it I am very much loved by the earth.
		 I will never be scared of darkness.
		 The sun will always be there 
		 because the sun may fall but it will always rise.

		 Here is a very important quote to me:
