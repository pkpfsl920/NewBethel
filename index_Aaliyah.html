			<h3 style="color:HotPink;">At STEM Camp. I've learned about microcontrollers. Micro controllers are basically a computer system on a chip that helps things to interact with each using a smart device and a cord. Some of the things that we've done with them are get a light to blink faster or slower, make a (very annoying) noise with a button, and we used an ultrasonic distance sensor to tell the distance between itself and a moving object in it's "view". We've used things like the breadboard, LED light, ultrasonic distance sensor, buttons, resistors, buzzors, and the arduino board.</h3>

			<h3 style="color:Violet;">I've also been helping to teach students about CAD(Computer Aided Design) and HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). We've been showing the students how to create cubes and objects with their names in it. We helped them to create cubes with symobls, words, names, and more on their cubes and to bring their drawings out to stick out or in.</h3>

			<h3 style="color:Orange;">We've taught them how to code their own websites. This includes links,pictures/memes, videos/gifs, change the background color, and change the text color. I've also been able to get more expirience in leadership and teaching. Today, the students have creatd their own websites to showcase their expirience here at STEM Camp, I hope you enjoy! </h3>
